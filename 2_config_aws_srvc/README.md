# CONFIGURE AWS SERVICES

Now that you have completed setting up the workshop enviornment, there are just a few more steps so the services communicate with each other. These steps will configure Kinesis to use managed streaming for Kafka and allow viewing the Kafka topics through a viewer interface.

These are the services that will be used:

1. Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (Amazon MSK)
2. Amazon DynamoDB
3. Amazon Kinesis
4. AWS CloudFormation
